# E5 baseline

`notebooks/e5_baseline_experiment.ipynb` is the smoke-friendly entry point for
the CosQA E5-base-v2 baseline. The full-dataset entry point is
`notebooks/e5_baseline_full_experiment.ipynb`, which hard-codes benchmark mode
and refuses to write a result if a subset is selected. Both notebooks load the
pinned Hugging Face dataset revision, use text-only `query: ` / `passage: `
inputs, and evaluate with the COIR evaluator at `nDCG@10`.

Install the declared dependencies before opening the notebook:

```bash
python -m pip install -r code-retrieval/requirements.txt
```

The smoke notebook defaults to a real-model smoke run so that wiring can be
checked without encoding the full corpus. Smoke output is explicitly
non-benchmark evidence. The full notebook runs the complete CosQA test split
and corpus without needing `E5_BASELINE_MODE`. `E5_BASELINE_BATCH_SIZE` and
`E5_BASELINE_TORCH_THREADS` are explicit performance controls; the selected
values are written to metadata and cache identity.

```bash
E5_BASELINE_MODE=benchmark E5_BASELINE_BATCH_SIZE=128 E5_BASELINE_TORCH_THREADS=8 python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute code-retrieval/notebooks/e5_baseline_experiment.ipynb --output e5_baseline_full.executed.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=0
```

To execute the full notebook directly from the `code-retrieval` directory:

```bash
E5_BASELINE_BATCH_SIZE=128 E5_BASELINE_TORCH_THREADS=8 python -m nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/e5_baseline_full_experiment.ipynb --output e5_baseline_full.executed.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=0
```

On PowerShell, use `$env:E5_BASELINE_MODE='benchmark'` in the session before the
same command. Generated caches, results, and metadata are written below
Smoke output is written below `code-retrieval/artifacts/e5_baseline/`; full-run
output is written below `code-retrieval/artifacts/e5_baseline_full/`. Both are
ignored by Git.
